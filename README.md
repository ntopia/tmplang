## Dev env setup with a container

Build a container image using `Dockerfile` in the root directory. Start the container, then it gives you `/work` directory.
Clone this repository in it, and start development there.

## Build

- Building the grammar: run `make` in the root directory.

- Building a transpiler: run `make` in `src` directory.
